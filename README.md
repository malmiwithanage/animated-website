# 🌀 Zentry Inspired Animated Website 

Hey there! 👋  
This is a visually-rich, animated website I built for learning and exploring advanced UI/UX techniques, inspired by **Zentry**.  
It uses scroll-triggered animations, geometric transitions, and immersive video storytelling to create a luxurious and modern browsing experience.
